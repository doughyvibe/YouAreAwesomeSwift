# SwiftUI Concepts App

Today I'm bringing together everything I've learned plus new concepts:
- SwiftUI Constants and proper scope management
- Understanding variable visibility and lifecycle
- The One Button Conditional Challenge

## What I'm Building
A consolidated app that demonstrates:
- Button creation and styling
- State management with proper scope
- Conditional UI changes using a single button
- Organized code structure with constants

This represents my growing understanding of SwiftUI fundamentals and code organization!
