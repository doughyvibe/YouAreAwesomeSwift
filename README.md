# Swift Functions & Control Flow

Today I learned about functions and advanced control flow in Swift:

## Concepts Covered
- **Functions**: No parameter, multi-parameter, and return value functions
- **Syntax Optimization**: Removing `return` in single-expression functions
- **Guard Statements**: Early exit pattern for cleaner code
- **Advanced Switch Cases**: Using ranges in switch statements

## Skills Applied
Writing more organized, safe, and efficient Swift code with proper error handling and control flow.
