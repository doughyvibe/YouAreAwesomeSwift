# Swift Loops & Logic Enhancement

Today I learned about loops and applied them to improve my app's logic:

## Concepts Covered
- **While loops** and **Repeat-While loops**
- Explicit variable declarations
- Avoiding common loop errors
- Randomization without repetition

## App Enhancement
Applied loop knowledge to ensure the app never shows the same image or message twice in a row, creating a better user experience.

Building smarter, more dynamic SwiftUI apps!
