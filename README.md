# Swift Data Types & Type Safety

Today I learned about fundamental Swift data types and type management:

## Concepts Covered
- **Basic Types**: String, Bool, Int, and Double
- **Type Conversion**: Converting between different types
- **Type Declaration**: Implicit vs. Explicit type annotation
- **Error Handling**: Common type errors and how to fix them

## Practice Focus
Understanding Swift's strong type system and learning to work with different data types effectively.

Building a solid foundation in Swift's type safety principles!
